## Basic Overview of Project

This is the first portfolio page I've created using html and css.  
It relies on a setup of three html, with a base css styling all three of the html pages.  
The index is the base page, and can be used to include personal information of the user.  
The portfolio is a spot to contain images of projects the user creates, ideally adding on click links to said projects.  
The contact page contains a basic form where the visitor can get in touch with the modifier of the portfolio.

## resources Used

bootstrap for the javascript employed and some of the css  
fillmurray.com for aboutme pic  
http://www.cheeseipsum.co.uk/ for cheese ipsum  
Freepick.com for background cheese  
https://place-hold.it/ for the portfolio placeholder pictures  


## Further Development Plans

Changing out projects for more complex and defining ones, altering how things are generated on page as knowledge increases
