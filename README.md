## Basic Overview of Project

This is an update to the first portfolio page I've created using html and css.  
It relies on a setup of two html files, with a base css styling all three of the html pages.  
The index is the base page, and can be used to include personal information of the user.  
The portfolio is a spot to contain images of projects the user creates, ideally adding on click links to said projects.
